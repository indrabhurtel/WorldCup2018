***********Instructions for setting up the environment to execute our code*************
We created a web interface for each of the given two queries. 
We use PHP programming languages to develop the web interface.
To have our web interface setup, we should keep all four files i.e. index.php, db_connect.php, search_countryANDcard.php, and search_keyword.php in a folder called phpmyadmin which is find inside XAMPP folder. 
Once all the files are placed under the same folder, we can run local host.
Then, you will be able to see the web interface and do given queries.
